# UniHub â€“ Campus Management App

We are **Team CYC**, and we are proud to introduce **UniHub** for the Campus Management track.  

## About the Project
Today's campus experience is fragmented and insecure, defined by multiple disconnected apps and slow emergency systems. **UniHub** is our integrated solution, designed to make campus life smarter and safer.  

Our app combines:
- **Safety features**: emergency button + live tracking  
- **Campus essentials**: digital student ID, bus schedules

UniHub brings all these into **one seamless, secure, and user-friendly platform** for the entire campus community.
